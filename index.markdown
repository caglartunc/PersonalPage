Hi! I am a faculty member at [Sabanci University, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences](https://fens.sabanciuniv.edu/en), in [Electronics Engineering Program](https://ee.sabanciuniv.edu/). My research interests are in communication technologies and services for 6G networks, including Network Digital Twins, O-RAN, AI-native architectures, NTNs and quantum communications. More broadly, I enjoy working on various problems related to wireless communication and networks, modeling and performance analysis of random systems.

Before joining Sabanci University, I have worked at [Turkcell](https://www.turkcell.com.tr) 6GEN Telecommunications and AI Lab, İstanbul, Türkiye. Before that, I have worked at [AT&T Labs Research](https://about.att.com/sites/labs_research), Bedminster, NJ, as a Senior Inventive Scientist between 2022-2024. I have spent three summers (2017, 2018 and 2019) working as an intern at Futurewei Technologies, where we have investigated machine learning-based methods for improving the performance of link adaptation and carrier aggregation in LTE and 5G NR. I have also worked at [Samsung Research America (SRA)](https://www.sra.samsung.com/life-at-sra/) during the Summer of 2020 on electric and magnetic fields (EMF)-based power control methods for 5G NR. As of March 2024, I joined the Editorial Board of [IEEE Wireless Communications Letters](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=5962382) as an Associate Editor.

I received my Ph.D. degree in February 2022, from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, under the supervision of Prof. [Shivendra Panwar](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/shivendra-panwar). My Ph.D. research focused on the design and analysis of low-latency future cellular networks. I mainly focused on the analysis of blockage-prone millimeter-wave (mmWave) links to provide high-data rate and low-latency mobile access. I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2013; and my M.S. degree from the same department in 2016, under the supervision of Prof. [Nail Akar](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~akar/).
